# KMC (time of flight)


To compile and run this you only need to run one command `./run` in the main directory.
You maybe need to make run executable with `chomd +x run`.

## Dependencies

To make it work make sure you have the Boost and Eigen libraries installed.
These are the same dependencies as VOTCA has. So if VOTCA works this will work.
