# KMC

This is a kinetic Monte Carlo simulator for optoelectronic processes in disordered organic materials. Currently it is specifically made for a model system of TCNE and benzene.

### Dependencies

The current implementation uses some functionality from the Eigen and Boost libraries, see <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/> and <https://www.boost.org/>.
